description: "Created a website for a small local business that sells anime merchandise. The website uses Strapi (headless CMS) to manage products and blog posts. I contributed to the design, header, footer, both blog pages, and home page, as well as configuration with Strapi. We hosted the backend on Ubuntu through Digital Ocean and the frontend with Vercel."
