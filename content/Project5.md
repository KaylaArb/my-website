description: In a hackathon dedicated to celebrating women, we won the prize for Best UX/UI Design with our project Me2U. Me2U is a social platform that provides a safe space for women to create and share their story. We were able to accomplish both a web application and a figma mobile prototype to showcase Me2u in 24 hours.
